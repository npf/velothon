Description
===========

This project aims at developing a challenge game for events such as
Telethon or inter-village games.
Each village or neighborhood is a team. A team is composed of bikers
and sponsors. Sponsors pay for bikers to pedal.
At the end of the event, the winner is the team that covered the
longest distance, and the money earned for the sponsors is to the 
benefit of the event, e.g. Telethon.

Tools developed for this project are:

* a electronic device with capters that is plugged on home-trainer
bicycles (we use home made bicycle counters in order to be able to
connect them to a computer for only a few euros)

* a software to run on the capter device (we use a Arduino board to
fetch the capters data and send it to a computer thru the serial/USB
link)

* a software to handle information received from the capter device
and display it to the event's participants (on a giant video projector
screen) and to control the game mechanisms, such as managing teams,
bikers and sponsors, starting counters, and so on.


For now, the prototype is composed of a capter device for 10 bikes
(10 capters) controled by an C-like program running on a Arduino. 
The software interface is written in Ruby/Gtk.
